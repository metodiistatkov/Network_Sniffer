# Network_Sniffer

A packet sniffer for Linux systems, which inspects packets on Ethernet, Network, Transport, and Presentation layers. Besides packet monitoring, the program has some Intrusion Detection characteristics. It can detect TOR traffic and potential ARP spoofing attacks (if the default gateway information on the host is not spoofed already).
